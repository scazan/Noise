# Noise
A work for an army of megaphones demonstrating in a public space. Ordinary objects are amplified using the megaphones occasionally producing unexpected feedback. Originally scored using data collected from Google on the frequency of the word 'history' (and it's variants) over the course of our known history.

Composed for Ensemble Zwischentöne & Orchester für Direkte Demokratie.
